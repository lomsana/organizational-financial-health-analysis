# organizational-financial-health-analysis
Financial data cleaning and analysis project evaluating organizational health across multiple divisions using structured data derived from audited PDF financial reports and exploratory dashboard analysis.

## Research Question
How can cleaned financial data from multiple organizational divisions be used to assess overall financial health and identify variation in performance across units?

## Data Source & Structure
- **Source:** Financial reports originally provided in PDF format
- **Scope:** 18 organizational divisions
- **Data types:** Revenue, expenses, balance-related indicators
- **Preprocessing:** Manual and automated PDF-to-Excel conversion followed by standardization

> Note: This repository does not include raw financial files to protect organizational confidentiality.

## Analysis Workflow
1. Audited financial reports were collected in PDF format.
2. Financial statements were converted into structured Excel datasets.
3. Data were cleaned and standardized across divisions.
4. Division-level datasets were consolidated into a longitudinal structure (2016–2020).
5. Key financial indicators were calculated and compared across divisions.
6. Aggregated organizational metrics were used to assess overall financial health.

The workflow provides a high-level overview of the analytical process, with methodological details described in the subsequent section.

## Methods
1. Extracted financial variables from PDF-based audited reports into Excel.
2. Cleaned and standardized financial variables across divisions.
3. Consolidated multi-division data into a unified analysis dataset.
4. Calculated key financial indicators to assess organizational health.
5. Created visual dashboards to compare performance across divisions.

## Key Findings
- At the organizational level, total assets increased consistently across the study period.
- Liabilities and expenses remained relatively stable over time.
- Revenues showed an overall upward trend, with the exception of a decline observed in 2020.

## Limitations
- Data completeness varied across divisions, which limited the ability to perform full comparative analysis for certain units.

## Value to the Organization
This analysis demonstrates how structured financial data can support organizational oversight, resource allocation, and early identification of divisions requiring additional financial support or intervention.

## Figures
Visual outputs and dashboards generated for this analysis are not included in this repository due to the confidential nature of the underlying financial data. Figures were produced internally to support analysis and organizational reporting, but are intentionally withheld to protect sensitive financial information.

## Data Ethics & Confidentiality
All data used in this project were derived from audited financial statements containing sensitive organizational information. To maintain confidentiality and comply with ethical data handling standards, raw datasets, detailed tables, and visualizations are not publicly shared. The repository focuses on documenting analytical methods, research questions, and high-level findings rather than exposing sensitive financial records.
